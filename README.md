## Working with submodules in git

Setup global `git config --global diff.submodule log`

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/IAmAnubhavSaini/aiml_from_scratch.git

## OR
git clone https://github.com/IAmAnubhavSaini/aiml_from_scratch.git
cd aiml_from_scratch
git submodule init

```
